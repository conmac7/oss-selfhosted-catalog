# Open Source & Self-Hosted Catalog

<img src="/images/Open_Source_Initiative.svg" width="360" />

This is a curated collection of open-source and self-hosted software programs. This catalog serves as a comprehensive guide, featuring a title, an image, and a concise description for each listed software. 

It aims to provide an organized and informative resource primarily for enthusiasts, home servers, homelabs, and end-users who value their privacy and security, and are seeking to explore and adopt various open-source and self-hosted solutions across different domains and use cases. 

There are also listed some more professional software for IT specialists, sysadmins and Developers/Programmers but the aim isn't to provide tools, software, and solutions for this specific category. 

Finally, the aim of this collection is not to catalog every single open-source and self-hosted software that is available, but rather the most useful ones (in my opinion at least).
