<h1 align="center"> Open Source & Self-Hosted Catalog </h1>

<div align="center"> <img src="/images/Open_Source_Initiative.png" width="240" /> </div>

This is a curated collection of open-source and self-hosted software programs. This catalog serves as a comprehensive guide, featuring a title, an image, and a concise description for each listed software. 

It aims to provide an organized and informative resource primarily for enthusiasts, home servers, homelabs, and end-users who value their privacy and security, and are seeking to explore and adopt various open-source and self-hosted solutions across different domains and use cases.

Some more professional software for IT specialists, sysadmins, and developers/programmers is also listed, but the aim isn't to provide tools, software, and solutions for this specific category.

Finally, the aim of this collection is not to catalog every single open-source and self-hosted software that is available, but rather the most useful ones (in my opinion at least).

<h3 id="serenity-os" align="center">SerenityOS</h3>
SerenityOS is a free and open source desktop operating system that has been in continuous development since 2018. Initially the one-man project of Swedish programmer Andreas Kling, SerenityOS is now developed by a community of hobbyists.

The system supports the x86-64 instruction set, features a preemptive kernel, and hosts multiple complex applications including its own web browser and integrated development environment (IDE)

SerenityOS aims to be a modern Unix-like operating system, with a look and feel that emulates 1990s operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. Incorporating third-party code into the system is discouraged.

The web browser for instance, does not use a preexisting web engine such as WebKit, instead using its own known as LibWeb. There is a collection of ported software, such as GCC, Git and Doom, with varying levels of functionality.

Development does not adhere to a release cycle; as such, there are no releases. Additionally, no binary distributions are provided and prospects are expected to build the system from source.

The system is written in what the authors call "Serenity C++", a variant of C++ that lacks exceptions and features its own standard library.
