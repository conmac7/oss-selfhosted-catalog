This is a curated collection of open-source and self-hosted software programs. This catalog serves as a comprehensive guide, featuring a title, corresponding links(homepage, github, git), a concise description and an image for each listed software. 

It aims to provide an organized and informative resource primarily for enthusiasts, home server owners/Admins, homelabbers and end-users who value their privacy and security, and are seeking to explore and adopt various open-source and self-hosted solutions across different domains and use cases.

Some more professional software for IT specialists, sysadmins, and developers/programmers is also listed, but the aim isn't to provide tools, software, and solutions for this specific category.
<p id="license"></p>
Finally, the aim of this collection is not to catalog every single open-source and self-hosted software that is available, but rather the most useful ones (in my opinion at least).

Distributed social network. With focus on decentralization, privacy, interoperability.

Friendica is a distributed social network application. Which allow users to connect with others via their own Friendica server, but may also fully integrate contacts from other platforms including Twitter, diaspora*, Pump.io and StatusNet into their 'newsfeed'.

There are two options to choose from to try Friendica:

The first option is to join one of the already installed Friendica server listed at http://dir.friendica.social/servers

The second option is to install your own server at https://github.com/friendica/friendica/releases Both options are fully free.

Friendica runs on commodity hosting platforms powered by PHP/MySQL/Apache. If you can install Drupal or Wordpress you can probably install Friendica. A single Friendica installation supports up to several thousand members.

The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is an anonymous network layer (implemented as a mix network) that allows for censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer communication. Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user's traffic (by using end-to-end encryption), and sending it through a volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world. Given the high number of possible paths the traffic can transit, a third party watching a full connection is unlikely. The software that implements this layer is called an "I2P router", and a computer running I2P is called an "I2P node". I2P is free and open sourced, and is published under multiple licenses.

IPFS is the permanent web. A new peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol.

IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines ideas from Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the web. It is like a single bittorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. IPFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built in. You can also mount the world at /ipfs. IPFS could become a new major subsystem of the internet. If built right, it could complement or replace HTTP.

It offers two approaches:

- content-addressing (ipfs://)
- uploader-addressing (ipns://) allowing for mutable sites.

Solid (Social Linked Data)[1] is a web decentralization project.

The project "aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy by developing a platform for linked-data applications that are completely decentralized and fully under users' control rather than controlled by other entities. The ultimate goal of Solid is to allow users to have full control of their own data, including access control and storage location. To that end, Tim Berners-Lee formed a company called Inrupt to help build a commercial ecosystem to fuel Solid.

In more detail, Solid consists of the following components:

- An organized collection of standards and data formats/vocabularies providing the same capabilities that centralized social media services offer, such as identity, authentication, login, permission lists, contact management, messaging, feed subscriptions, comments, discussions, and others.
- Specifications and design notes describing a REST API to extend existing standards, to guide developers building servers or applications.
- Servers that implement the Solid specification.
- A test suite for testing and validating Solid implementations.
- An ecosystem of social applications, identity providers, and helper libraries that run on the Solid platform.
- A community providing documentation, discussion, tutorials, and presentations.

Tor, short for The Onion Router is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. It directs Internet traffic via a free, worldwide volunteer overlay network that consists of more than seven thousand relays.

Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace a user's Internet activity. Tor protects personal privacy by concealing a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or traffic analysis. It protects the user's freedom and ability to communicate confidentially through IP address anonymity using Tor exit nodes.

WebTorrent is a peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming torrent client written in JavaScript

The idea behind WebTorrent is to make a BitTorrent-like protocol that works on the web browser, maintaining as much compatibility with BitTorrent as possible

The WebTorrent Desktop bridges the two networks of WebRTC-based WebTorrent and TCP/UDP-based BitTorrent simultaneously. The BitTorrent client Vuze (formerly Azureus) less gracefully but adequately functionally incorporated WebTorrent adding simultaneous network bridging to their software.

Open, free and uncensorable websites, using Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent network

ZeroNet is a decentralized web-like network of peer-to-peer users

Instead of having an IP address, sites are identified by a public key (specifically a bitcoin address). The private key allows the owner of a site to sign and publish changes, which propagate through the network. Sites can be accessed through an ordinary web browser when using the ZeroNet application, which acts as a local webhost for such pages.

ZeroNet is not anonymous by default, but it supports routing traffic through the Tor network

ShareDrop is a web application inspired by Apple AirDrop service. It allows you to transfer files directly between devices, without having to upload them to any server first. It uses WebRTC for secure peer-to-peer file transfer and Firebase for presence management and WebRTC signaling.

ShareDrop allows you to send files to other devices in the same local network (i.e. devices with the same public IP address) without any configuration - simply open https://www.sharedrop.io on all devices and they will see each other. It also allows you to send files between networks - just click the + button in the top right corner of the page to create a room with a unique URL and share this URL with other people you want to send a file to. Once they open this page in a browser on their devices, you'll see each other's avatars.

The main difference between ShareDrop and AirDrop is that ShareDrop requires Internet connection to discover other devices, while AirDrop doesn't need one, as it creates ad-hoc wireless network between them. On the other hand, ShareDrop allows you to share files between mobile (Android and iOS) and desktop devices and even between networks.

Assist in organizing your piles of documents, resulting from scanners, e-mails and other sources with miminal effort.

Docspell is a personal document organizer. Or sometimes called a "Document Management System" (DMS). You'll need a scanner to convert your papers into files. Docspell can then assist in organizing the resulting mess 😉. It can unify your files from scanners, emails and other sources. It is targeted for home use, i.e. families, households and also for smaller groups/companies.

You can associate tags, set correspondends and lots of other predefined and custom metadata. If your documents are associated with such meta data, you can quickly find them later using the search feature. But adding this manually is a tedious task. Docspell can help by suggesting correspondents, guessing tags or finding dates using machine learning. It can learn metadata from existing documents and find things using NLP. This makes adding metadata to your documents a lot easier. For machine learning, it relies on the free (GPL) Stanford Core NLP library.

Docspell also runs OCR (if needed) on your documents, can provide fulltext search and has great e-mail integration. Everything is accessible via a REST/HTTP api. A mobile friendly SPA web application is the default user interface. An Android app exists for conveniently uploading files from your phone/tablet and a cli. The feature overview lists some more points.

SerenityOS is a free and open source desktop operating system that has been in continuous development since 2018. Initially the one-man project of Swedish programmer Andreas Kling, SerenityOS is now developed by a community of hobbyists.

The system supports the x86-64 instruction set, features a preemptive kernel, and hosts multiple complex applications including its own web browser and integrated development environment (IDE)

SerenityOS aims to be a modern Unix-like operating system, with a look and feel that emulates 1990s operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. Incorporating third-party code into the system is discouraged.

The web browser for instance, does not use a preexisting web engine such as WebKit, instead using its own known as LibWeb. There is a collection of ported software, such as GCC, Git and Doom, with varying levels of functionality.

Development does not adhere to a release cycle; as such, there are no releases. Additionally, no binary distributions are provided and prospects are expected to build the system from source.

The system is written in what the authors call "Serenity C++", a variant of C++ that lacks exceptions and features its own standard library.

OpenVPN is a virtual private network (VPN) system that implements techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It implements both client and server applications.

OpenVPN allows peers to authenticate each other using pre-shared secret keys, certificates or username/password. When used in a multiclient-server configuration, it allows the server to release an authentication certificate for every client, using signatures and certificate authority.

It uses the OpenSSL encryption library extensively, as well as the TLS protocol, and contains many security and control features. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network address translators (NATs) and firewalls

The search engine for openly licensed media. 500 million Creative Commons licensed images and more.

There is no larger compendium of shared human knowledge and creativity than the Commons, including over 1.1 billion digital works available under CC licenses. Despite the tremendous growth of the Commons, and the widespread use of the CC licenses and public domain marks, there is no simple way to maximize use of, and engagement with, all of that content. There is no front door — no tool designed for the general public to facilitate discovery for the purpose of reuse and remix, to simplify the license terms, make attribution easy, or support curation, and crowdsourced metadata.

Creative Commons’ “Openverse” (formerly CC Search) project will develop and release an open online search and re-use tool that will allow high-quality content from the commons to surface in a more seamless and accessible way.

Our first prototype relies on open APIs and focuses on photos as its first media type. It is meant to elicit discussion and inform our development as we build out the full set of tools. “Openverse” will enable users to curate, tag, and remix that content.

It will go beyond simple search to aggregate results from across the hundreds of public repositories into a single ledger, and also facilitate the use and re-use through tools like curated lists, saved searches, one- or no-click attribution, and provenance.

YaCy is free software for your own search engine.

Join a community of search engines or make your own search portal

- P2P Mode: Web Search by the people, for the people: decentralized, all users are equal, no central, no search request storage, shared index.
- Your Search Portal: Your YaCy installation is independent from other peers. Define your own web index and starting your own web crawl
- Intranet Search: Create a search portal for your intranet or web pages or your (shared) file system.
YaCy is a free search engine that anyone can use to build a search portal for their intranet or to help search the public internet. When contributing to the world-wide peer network, the scale of YaCy is limited only by the number of users in the world and can index billions of web pages.

It is fully decentralized, all users of the search engine network are equal, the network does not store user search requests and it is not possible for anyone to censor the content of the shared index.

Compared to semi-distributed search engines, the YaCy-network has a distributed architecture. All YaCy-peers are equal and no central server exists. It can be run either in a crawling mode or as a local proxy server, indexing web pages visited by the person running YaCy on their computer.
