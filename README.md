<h1 align="center"> Open Source & Self-Hosted Catalog </h1>

<div align="center"> <img src="/images/Open_Source_Initiative.png" width="240" /> </div>

This is a curated collection of open-source and self-hosted software programs. This catalog serves as a comprehensive guide, featuring a title, an image, and a concise description for each listed software. 

It aims to provide an organized and informative resource primarily for enthusiasts, home servers, homelabs, and end-users who value their privacy and security, and are seeking to explore and adopt various open-source and self-hosted solutions across different domains and use cases.

Some more professional software for IT specialists, sysadmins, and developers/programmers is also listed, but the aim isn't to provide tools, software, and solutions for this specific category.

Finally, the aim of this collection is not to catalog every single open-source and self-hosted software that is available, but rather the most useful ones (in my opinion at least).
